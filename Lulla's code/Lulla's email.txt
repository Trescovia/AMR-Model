- files named model_* include codes for the different sub-models at each level

- files named RA_main* include codes that enable running the models step by step for the different scenarios

- files names variable* include parameter definitions for all models in the different scenarios
- analyse_output is a script that includes functions to generate outputs (graphics and files)

Hope this is not too messy !

Again, the aim was to use a quite generic approach to gather all the components in a single model. 
All link functions are very basic (and their choice can also be considered arbitrary), 
a mechanistic approach would certainly do better. Curious of your results!
